It's ok to expand into other regions, but that's important but not in the context of this celebration.

We in the community expected more, at least a live stream with presentations from the IF and start-ups, a nicer, larger location where there is also more support.

You've shut yourself out and been just among yourselves and that tells us a lot in the community how you feel about our community.  Instead, we were able to see small excerpts of how you get drunk with 30 people.

For instance your WASM VM doesn't make any sense from a risk reward perspective especially since it doesn't offer anything new in comparison to EVM, but it's a huge risk for developers to learn since it's only used in IOTA. Improve the EVM, adopt MOVE and major other solutions used by other ecosystems. Improve them. Make good debugging tools etc etc... ",Holepunch and p2p in general. You guys are good with Bitfinex try integrating their Holepunch framework once it's open source. Yoy can't scale better than p2p and have a better UX,"That's good. Make it general and not specific, but deliver. Other ecosystems are years ahead.","Soonaverse only doing some new things on IOTA, others just forking L1 Ethereum which doesn't make sense.","Just make good tech that really is a pleasure to work with that has better DX and UX and then just promote it to developers. If developers want to build with it, it will transition to a successful ecosystem. Don't over complicate things and start catching up to other ecosystems. Being slightly better won't convince devs to change from other ecosystems. "

I think real world adoption is important and working with industry partners like ETO too. But I think you have to do something exciting - and pillars are not an exciting product. 
Go, work with Tesla - use a Tesla (this time a real one and not a small one like years ago) and show the potential of the Iota technology compared to Ethereum - You have to use videos comparing your technology with others - by using a Tesla while charging showing what you can do, you not only use the strong brand of Tesla but also will get a lot of more news coverage. 

If you are presented in the news - there should be one discription that is easy to understand, what iota is and why it is important. You should provide sth. Like this for the news paper writers in order to get one cristal clear message out there! Currently it is not streamlined enough - saying that you will do everything - but have you have to focus und promote yourself about one purpose / vision / use case 

Maybe u do a comparison video showing Bitcoin as the first car - Etherum the second - and iota is now a 21 century car which is much more advanced - use pictures in the head of people - currently it is too far away from them to get interested - you have to pick people up right from where they are - not assume they will come to you anyway because your technology is superior!

Let’s stop spending ungodly amounts of money on NFT projects that exist only to exist and, in most cases, eventually crash. It’s not even about civic responsibility or altruism. When did we become so unambitious? When did we become so self-involved, motivated only by profit, and interested only in solving insular problems? ""

The wallet itself is fantastic in it's UX department, but there are just not a whole lot of features next to being a wallet.

It would be great if projects would be able to create their addins for Firefly to connect their projects with the wallet directly in ways they see fit. On/offramps, identity plugins, DAO feeds, staking views, NFT views, etc.

This way the wallet will be a one stop shop for all needs, managed by the projects themselves.

Also, a way to connect the wallet to a metamask like application is sorely needed. Metamask is still the default for most connections with projects.",The biggest lack is a easy connection method from FireFly to the browser. Metamask does not suffice and is complicated for many users. Wider adoption will only happen if it's very easy to interact with various projects.,"The wallet UX is absolutely fantastic and i'm sure the technical side is too. It does really lack features.

IOTA needs to have a much bigger scope to get enough attention. It is clear the small scope is too niche still. A big ecosystem is the only way to survive.",,"What IOTA needs most of all is 3 things:
- A network with actual modern capabilities at the very least, Smart Contracts, Tokenisation, etc. This is worked hard on so this will come in time.

- A even bigger focus on attracting as many developers/(existing) projects as possible. Luckily we have great programs like Touchpoint, a very good Wiki and many other things so this is also being worked on. I do hope there will be the possibility to work with the new Smart Contracts AG (?) to distribute funds more freely into DAO's/projects focussing on actual adoption. Adoption will only come with developers who know the strenghts of IOTA and are able to work with it. More programs and financial incentives  will be very useful. Money simply talks, the more projects port to IOTA the better. IOTA + bridges can be a very good combination because of feelessness and flexibility of the network.

- A namechange. Alright, that is a joke but the point I am making is that IOTA has a, in my opinion, bad reputation with many people and developers in the space. This due to things that happened long ago and the fact there has been a wrong direction for many years, putting us back many years in development. This is ofcourse being worked on and I hope that with actual delivery the perspective of IOTA will change. We really need a fully fledged modern network, coördicide (which has become a meme at this point to be honest, simply due to the fact it has been dropped so many times as ""almost there"") and clear communication on the status of project and where they are headed. No ETA's required, but atleast a broad expectation of what to expect. Example being Assembly."

I'm still waiting for Hans YouTube series of iota 2.0. Doesn't have to be Hans, but someone who will talk about it in all details.

Build hype for a finished, functioning project with an imminent release, not for something still in research.

Market.  With a proven firm that knows how to market crypto.  There has been nothing but callous mismanagement of marketing and PR.  No announcements, no hype, no teasers and scavenger hunts with a giggling founder that leads to the community doing a deep search of the internet for what amounts to virtually nothing.  All communication should happen only after going through a real, credible, experienced marketing/PR firm that has the authority to tell the IF no when Dom and company have another very bad idea on how to build excitement or to release an announcement.  Stop asking the community for marketing ideas.  Hire some experts.  Spend some money on it.  If they do their job, it should reflect in the price which would result in an ROI far greater than the initial investment for the IF.

""P"" parties in discord spec are not reflective of Crypto's overall sentiment towards Iota.  Discord is an echo chamber.  The larger crypto world doesn't even care about Iota enough to laugh at it anymore.  A fully functioning product with real use, not theoretical use-cases, is the only thing that will allow Iota to escape from the hole it has dug.

ANY of the various partnerships need to actually be pushed to produce something real.
It's very transparent that the IF has continually created new hype around the next big thing, to keep the community excited, because they have wholly failed to deliver anything surrounding the old things.  

If the foundation stopped today, the project is unquestionably dead.  This is because there is nothing delivered and no external excitement to keep it going.  Finish what you've started before launching into something additional.  Focus.  

Any real delivery of an actual fully released product that is actually used in the real world is absolutely critical.  This is an existential moment for the project.  If there are any more missteps or delays, I see zero chance that it succeeds.  

The past five-plus  years of work can produce something revolutionary, or just be that thing that gave some good ideas for other projects to copy to produce a different, working product in the future, while your investors lose literal millions trying to support and believe in your mismanaged vision."

Crypto meetings sponsored by iota, possibly Dao

Better presentations. Sometimes they are horrible. Like last year in Saudi Arabia
More cooperations with companies respectively getting companies to use/integrate iota

Integrating some governance tools to possibly help DAO's also take votes on their agendas.

So basically easy swapping of IOTA ecosystem tokens inside Firefly.","Lack of features on the mobile version(s) of Firefly.
The current Firefly mobile version lacks support for staking, governance, Ledger integration, etc.
Firefly Shimmer mobile version isn't even out yet.
Most people nowadays like to use smartphones, especially when showcasing something.
Almost everyone has them, people are comfortable using them, they're convenient because almost anyone can immediately try out something you've just demonstrated or talked about.

Or even create (mint) a new token within minutes and share it with people attending a conference you're currently presenting at or attending. Showcase how you can do it almost effortlessly with just your mobile phone, withing minutes, using very few funds and it could have a great networking and marketing effect.
Sadly, mobile Firefly features seem to be lagging behind the desktop wallet(s) and they could be the best marketing tool used to attract new people to the ecosystem and introduce them to our great community. ","It would be great if we could have an option of downloading an .apk for Android phones on the official website.

The TanglePay wallet (the alternative to Firefly) already has the option to download an .apk file on their website, albeit without any special warnings or instructions.",8,,,I think it's great to broaden ones horizons and also course correct when necessary. IMHO it was a smart move to not let yourself be constrained to a very niche market when your newly developed/developing and transformed technology can help build so much more outside of that niche.

They have very interesting tokenomics and a very vibrant community

and some of the aspects of their tokenomics (like the ""storage fund"") should imho at least be considered as a part of the future Assembly tokenomics (if it fits with the current or future ASMB vision).
They also have a great github page titled ""How Sui Differs from Other Blockchains""
https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/doc/src/learn/sui-compared.md
where they go into details about what sets them apart from other typical blockchains.
A similar page could be very useful for IOTA, SMR, ASMB (when feature complete and launched). 
What would also be great is a nice, easy to understand graphical presentation on differences between IOTA, SMR and ASMB when all are up and running with different features, so developers and users can compare at a glance which features each network has and what differentiates the three. It would immensely help developers decide where to start in regards to what their project requires (and if a network has all the features they require in order to complete their project) and also help educate users on everything they can do within a given network.

Some others too which are built in the ecosystems of the above, like VyFi, World Mobile Token, Balance, OMM, TNode, IQ protocol. Their message is usually to bring something sustainable into people's lives not just revenue but also connectivity or being participant in the global economy.","Education. Your technology and the blockchain/tangle tech is rather cyberpunk. A lot of people have difficulties even with smartphone apps and email. Some find it difficult to keep up with the advancements. And the reason is sometimes that people simply don't have time to go through all the information and filter what is useful and what not. Not even the young people, while these techs will be a part of their everyday's life. I even tell them ""when I was at their age"" we only have a single phone booth for 3 streets, while now our breathing stops without 4G.

So, some educational program from the very basics (even for kids maybe, like DigitalEU) gradually to the ""deep dives"". Especially highlighting ""what is/will be the benefit/usefullness"" of all this and where they are in all this when they buy their IOTA/SMS/ASMB and stake those tokens."

","I'm okay with it as long as there are not critical design decisions being made totally cutting off the ability to use IOTA tech to power those use cases. If these critical design decision are being made today without the community being aware, in several years we'll be faced with additional protocol re-design or an entire shift away from the native roots of IOTA that sit in enabling IOT. ",,"- Execute & deliver tech (has been very good over last year, continue it!)
- Continue to focus on shifting power into the community hands (While ensuring not to leave any gaps in capability/tools that might hamper community engagement) . Enablement is key to do in parallel to decentralizing the iota community of developers and protocol. 
- Get iota plugged into way more existing CEXs and DEXs. Ease of use starts with ease of buying the token. If people cannot access the token they are 100% going to go towards developing + building on platforms that are offered in their geographies. 
- Get a full time representative within the IF to go on a constant roadshow doing interviews with youtube influencers, news outlets, speaking at events, doing livestreams, podcasts, writing op-eds, meeting with members from other communities (Maybe Terry Shane, maybe Dom, maybe a PR rep). Now that everything is close to built, having a trustworthy and well spoken human to focus entirely on spreading the word is essential as a first marketing step. Charles Hoskin seems to do this well but it does need to be a founder, just a personality who is good at public speaking. 
- Marketing (hackathons, and other paid marketing/incentives to attract more developers)"

I would like IOTA to market itself as a serious and ""grown up"" project.

Maybe it makes more sense to market IOTA not so much as a crypto solution, but more directly its use cases when they come to fruition (EBSI, digital identities, Project Alvarium).

Rightly or wrongly, I get the impression that for current crypto market participants IOTA isn't taken seriously as a project with a bright future due to reasons in the past. Trying to appeal to that crowd and changing their mind might be a losing battle, or put differently, it's not worth portraying IOTA as a competitor to many hyped projects whether it be through flashy NFTs or trying to appeal to the (seemingly) marginal (future) technological advantages over other DLTs. While many of IOTA's potential features might well be a game changer, such as lack of fees etc, they might not be a big enough difference at first glance to convince the average crypto user to turn their backs on their currently supported crypto, especially given IOTA's reputation for lofty promises without much to show for it. 

I think the IOTA Foundation should focus on developing its ecosystem as a mature project for mature purposes, as pompous as that may sound. When the time's right, position/market/advertise IOTA as a technology of the future rather than just another crypto project with slightly better performance metrics. Less competing against other cryptos as a show to the current crypto investors and market, and more positioning itself as an indispensable tool/backbone of future society to the general public who aren't as crypto obsessed. 

Once the major development goals have been implemented, try to detach IOTA from many of the crypto connotations rather than chase them. If they hopefully work out, projects such as EBSI, Alvarium and others should allow IOTA to stand on its own feet, stand out and even stand apart from the crypto madness and present itself as a standard ""tool"" for many things, without having to emphasise its ""cryptoness"". Don't chase the hype, set the standard. "
